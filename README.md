# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/temp/5

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

Tip: Open http://localhost:5173 after running the dev server to view the site (Vite default).

To view the POSER assets you added, open the Music Catalog and click the POSER card; the three new images appear in that album's page.
